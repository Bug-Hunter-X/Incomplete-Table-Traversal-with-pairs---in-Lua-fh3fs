This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Lua related to the `pairs` iterator and its interaction with nested tables containing `nil` values.  The `pairs` iterator will skip a nested table entirely if it encounters a `nil` key in that nested table before any other valid keys, resulting in an incomplete traversal of the data structure. The solution offers a recursive function that handles nil values gracefully, ensuring complete traversal and proper processing of all table elements, regardless of nil keys.
